# TECHIN515 Lab 3: ESP32 Sorting Hat

## Overview
In this lab, you will build a magical sorting hat using an ESP32 and machine learning. The sorting hat will classify students into different houses based on their characteristics. 

## Learning Objectives
- Develop skills in data collection and preprocessing
- Implement a classification system using decision tree
- Create an interactive and engaging user experience

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- 4 push buttons
- OLED display (Adafruit SSD1306)
- USB cable
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- ESP32 board support package
- Required libraries:
  - TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
  - Adafruit SSD1306


## Tasks
1. Create your dataset to train the sorting hat.
   - Create at least five responses to all questions and label them.
   - Talk to other students, and collect responses generated by at least five other students. This should give you at least 30 entries in the dataset.
2. Use `sorting_hat_laptop.py` to train your decision tree and convert it to C++ for ESP32.
3. Wire your ESP32 with buttons and OLED display. An example is shown in the figure below. Update the sketch `sorting_hat_esp_button.ino` accordingly, depending on how you wire the sorting hat.

4. Play with your sorting hat. Are all 10 questions important to create the sorting hat? If you were to remove some questions to improve user experience, which questions would you remove and justify your answer.

## Deliverables
1. Picture or video of your working sorting hat prototype
2. Source code with comments
3. Brief documentation of your implementation
